<h1 id='heading'><b>What is an E-commerce website?</b></h1>
<P>
	Electronic commerce commonly known as e-commerce or eCommerce, is a type of industry where the buying and selling of
	 products or services is conducted over electronic systems such as the Internet.A e commerce website is a place to do 
	 business through internet, sellers and customers communicate and do the deal through internet.An e-commerce website is 
	 a website that is developed to enable businesses to sell their products over the internet to customers. Ecommerce is the 
	 largest retail environment growth area in the world.In this era of technology eveything from gifts, books and perfumes through 
	 to the weekly grocery can be bougth online , in simple words if you are selling products or service an Ecommerce website is your
	 virtual 'shop'letting your visitors see your products from the comfort of their own home. 
</P>
	
<h1 id='heading'>Why e commerce is important?</h1>
<p>
	With the development of the Internet, the ability to send information is now incredibly fast. 
	Companies have realized this fact and have used the Internet as a tool to expand their businesses. 
	E-commerce, or electronic commerce, is a way to conduct minor and major business transactions online 
	instead of going into a store. It provides convenience for people who would rather be shipped an item 
	from a store instead of going to the actual store to purchase it. For major manufacturing businesses, 
	it helps them to purchase materials that they will need to make goods or provide services at sometimes 
	lower costs and without the need of having to speak to someone directly. Since the Internet is constantly 
	active, there are no closing hours when businesses or people cannot purchase from a company or person selling
	 goods on an auction site like Ebay. Thus, increasing production by eliminating wait time of ordering production 
	 materials or services and increasing profits by being able to continue selling products 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
	 So what do you need to make an ecommerce
	 website effective?
</p>
<p>
	<h1 id ='heading'>Bringing in the coustomer</h1>
			
			
				<p>For any ecommerce website to be effective there are a few things that need to be in place before you
				 ‘open for business’. Like any shop window, 
				an ecommerce website has to be eye-catching,
				 effective and offer potential customers what
				  they want. So the first thing that has to be right is your SEO or
search engine optimisation. Without a good page ranking, your
 shop will remain empty and the customers will be spending their money on your rivals’ sites. An
effective ecommerce website should be vibrant, easy to navigate and well laid out, just like any other
 ‘real life’ shop. Ecommerce is all about the user experience, and your shop has to give your visitors the best user
  experience it possibly can.</p>
			
		
		<h1 id='heading'>Security – the number one issue</h1>
			<p>The reason that ecommerce websites took a while to gain precedence is that many people were worried about
			 typing in their credit card details into the Internet because of the fear of fraud. So your site has to be
			  secure. Offering an https checkout page is a must. Https notification indicates that the site is protected 
			  and that visitor’s card information will be safe from hackers or scammers. The advent of PayPal has also made
			   things more secure online, so accepting PayPal payments is now a necessity if your ecommerce website is to be
			    successful.
			   </p>


			
	
		<h1 id='heading'>A site that’s easy to navigate</h1>
		<p>a good ecommerce website has to be easy to navigate. Sitemaps are vital, letting your visitors find their way around
		 your virtual shop easily. However, there also has to be a clear roadmap that guides them gently (without the hard sell)
		  towards the end goal, namely a checkout cart filled with your products. Good ecommerce websites
		 have a strong call to action on every page, encouraging the visitor to convert that click into a cash buy.
		</p>
	
	<h1 id='heading'>Integrate the pages</h1>
	<p>Following on from your roadmap, consider how the pages work together as a whole. Think of a sales website as a department store,
	 where one page can quite easily lead into another through a simple and tempting link. Advertising special offers on various pages
	  through the use of banners or links encourages the visitor to explore your site rather than just sticking to one page.
	 </p>
	 	 <h1 id='heading'>Giving people what they want</h1>
	 	<p>Ecommerce websites are designed specifically for one purpose – selling. Visitors will want to know three fundamental questions when they visit your site:

• What’s for sale?

• How much is it?

• How do I buy it and can I use the site safely?

Keeping things simple, concise and clearly laid out is the art of
ecommerce website design. But if you want them to come back, encourage 
your visitors to interact with the site through comments, blogs and other
 two-way processes. Unique visitors are great, but the aim of an ecommerce
  website is to keep your visitors coming back for more. Fresh, engaging copy,
   content that encourages interaction and unique special offers all help to keep
    your website open for business.
